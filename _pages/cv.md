Academic Experience
======
* Patent. "A virtual dimension estimation method for hyperspectral images based on ridge ratio shrinkage". Patent number: ZL 2018 1 1595570.4. It estimates the actual dimensions of the hyperspectral images.
* Research Projects. I put what can be public on [CSDN](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_43759518?spm=1011.2124.3001.5343&type=blog) blogs. This [repository](https://github.com/ShianLin/csdn_blog) can be referred. Xi’an Jiaotong University pays the price of the papers, and the notes only currently available for applying. 
  * Machine learning, including classification and clustering, dimensionality reduction, ensemble, etc.
  * Random-projection (RP). It's to reduce matrix dimensions. [blog1, ](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_43759518/article/details/113813986?spm=1001.2014.3001.5502)[blog2(It proves that the blog is mine.), ](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_43759518/article/details/113774085)[blog3, ](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_43759518/article/details/116022476?spm=1001.2014.3001.5502)[blog4.](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_43759518/article/details/113455174)
  * Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). The method and its variants are frequently used in face recognition and hyperspectral images.
  * Sufficient dimension reduction(SDR). In statistics, sufficient dimension reduction is a paradigm for analyzing data that combines the ideas of dimension reduction with the concept of sufficiency. It's No.1 Google Chinese search [result](https://github.com/ShianLin/csdn_blog/blob/main/SDR_result.pdf) that my [blog](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_43759518/article/details/116307309) is, using 'Sufficient dimension reduction'(Chinese) only.
