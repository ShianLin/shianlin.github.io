Academic Experience
======
* Patent. "A virtual dimension estimation method for hyperspectral images based on ridge ratio shrinkage". Patent number: ZL 2018 1 1595570.4 
* Nonnegative matrix factorization [(NMF)](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_43759518/article/details/117848483?spm=1001.2014.3001.5502). This method and its variant are frequently used in hyperspectral images  
* [(Classification)](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_43759518/article/details/113951274?spm=1001.2014.3001.5502) and clustering
* Random projection (RP). Used to reduce matrix dimensions and reduce complexity by reducing the need for precision.
